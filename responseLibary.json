Then click 'My Plans'* under the heading 'My Account', and select 'View Dashboard' on the service for which you wish to change plan.&nbsp;<br />3. Then, select 'Change My Plan' which is under the expiry date . Then choose the plan from the drop-down list, and confirm your selection.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT NOTE - The plan change would be scheduled for the next recharge, so if auto-recharge is on for the service, the new plan would begin automatically when your current plan expires and you would be billed the full recharge price of the plan to which you're changing. If auto-recharge is OFF for the service, or if the current plan already expired, you would then need to manually recharge in order to trigger the new plan. &nbsp;Please also consider that if your current plan is not shown on our website https://colesmobile.com.au/, then after this plan change, you would not be able to go back to the original plan.</p></div>",

This process is called a 'port'.<br />Porting your mobile number to Coles Mobile is easy! During the activation of your new Coles Mobile SIM, there will be a step where you will be asked if you'd like to activate with a new mobile number, or keep your existing number. Please simply choose the option to keep you existing number, and you will then be required to type in your number in the space provided. After this, we will need to verify the ownership of the phone number.<br />To complete this part of the process, you will need to have access to your phone with your old SIM in it. After you enter you mobile number in the space provided, press the, 'Continue,' button, and you will be sent a verification SMS onto your old SIM card (please note if you do not have your old sim and the ability to receive a verification code you will not be able to progress with the port of your number).<br />After you have received this code, please enter it in the 'OTP,' section you will see on the webpage, and also fill out the rest of the required information on the page. Once this has been completed, please continue to the end of the activation process, then click the, 'Activate Now,' button to request the activation of your new sim.</p></div>",
